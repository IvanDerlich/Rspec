# Enumerables
Repo for Microverse Main Curriculum

## Brief introduction

This is a project for the Microverse program that involves recreating some functions (I guess the most used ones) with out code.
Those functions need to accomplish the same results as the original ones

This is a project for the Microverse program that involves using Enumerables for use

## Tasks

### 1:
Create #my_each, a method that is identical to #each but (obviously) does not use #each. You’ll need to remember the yield statement. Make sure it returns the same thing as #each as well.
### 2:
Create #my_each_with_index in the same way.
03-Create #my_select in the same way, though you may use
        my_each in your definition (but not #each).
### 3:
Create #my_all? (continue as above)
### 4:
Create #my_any?
### 5:
Create #my_none?
### 6:
Create #my_count
### 7:
Create #my_map
### 8:
Create #my_inject
### 9:
Test your #my_inject by creating a method called 
    #multiply_els which multiplies all the elements of the 
    array together by using #my_inject, e.g. 
    multiply_els([2,4,5]) #=> 40
    A description of the inject method:

### 10:
Modify your #my_map method to take a proc instead.
### 12:
Modify your #my_map method to take either a proc or a block. It won’t be necessary to apply both a proc and a block in the same #my_map call since you could get the same effect by chaining together one #my_map call with the block and one with the proc. This approach is also clearer, since the user doesn’t have to remember whether the proc or block will be run first. So if both a proc and a block are given, only execute the proc.
